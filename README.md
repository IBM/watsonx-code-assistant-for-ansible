## **Ansible Lightspeed Prompting Guide - Practical hands-on**

‚ñ∂Ô∏è _A code editor extension that captures and transmits prompt and context information for inference and captures feed-back from the user to improve model and service quality._

‚ñ∂Ô∏è _An inference pipeline for combining and processing natural language and Ansible-YAML to get code suggestions from a Large Language Models (LLMs)._

‚ñ∂Ô∏è _A content matching pipeline that finds training examples that are similar to the code suggestions._

‚ñ∂Ô∏è _An analysis framework that collects and processes feedback data to make it consumable by a wide range of analysis tools, ultimately for the purpose of improving model quality and user experience._

One of the key advantages of Ansible Lightspeed is its ability to leverage **context** and industry **best practices** to generate intelligent suggestions. As you use Ansible Lightspeed, you'll notice that it incorporates context from the overall Playbook and the specific task to provide more accurate recommendations. It analyzes the code you have already written and suggests improvements or additions based on established best practices.

  <summary>Here are a few key examples for your reference to enhance your experienceüëá</summary>

  <details>
    <summary>1. The clearer your Ansible task description, the better the inline prompt suggestions.</summary>

    - name: Ensure the RPM package [yum-utils] is installed on RHEL Linux servers
      # Content suggestion provided by Ansible Lightspeed
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
      ansible.builtin.package:
        name: yum-utils
        state: present

    - name: Execute command needs-restarting -r to check if reboot is required
      # Content suggestion provided by Ansible Lightspeed

      register: reboot_required_result
      changed_when: false
      failed_when: false

      # Content suggestion provided by Ansible Lightspeed
      ansible.builtin.template:
        src: chroot_tasks.j2
        dest: /tmp/chroot_tasks.sh

**_Final Tips for an Optimal Usability Experience_**

**1** - _Although generative AI can be incredibly useful, it can sometimes produce answers that aren't exactly what you're looking for, or it can give you suggestions that seem off track. If this happens, don't hesitate to rewrite or reformulate your request. Your opinion is fundamental in guiding the AI to provide more precise, meaningful and relevant answers._

**2** - _Do not hesitate to utilize extensive prompts; in certain scenarios, this approach can enhance the accuracy of prompt suggestions generated by the AI. In summary, a well-crafted prompt is crucial for optimal outcomes._
